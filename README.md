# Strava Analysis

I was a distance runner in high school, and I still love the sport of running.  I use the Strava app to track all of my runs, and I have been using it since July of 2019 up until today.  I mainly use it recreationally for tracking how far I run per week, but Strava tracks a lot of other information on any given run you log.

The Strava app allows you to download all of your data collected from the app, including all of your runs, paces, elapsed and moving time, elevation gain/loss, calories burned, and more.  As a data scientist, I was curious about what insights I could derive from the data available for download.
